### Package functions

*rapport* is shipped with a bunch of (hopefully) handy functions to help you with [generating reports](http://rapport-package.info/#usage) and [writing templates](http://rapport-package.info/#custom).

A detailed documentation based on up-to-date `Rd` files is also available below. Of course, you could check out the [manual of the stable package in _PDF_ format](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rapport) on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) too.
