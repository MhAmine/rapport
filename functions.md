### Package functions

*rapport* has some really handy functions to help writing templates besides the main functions that generate, format and export those.

For a short introduction check out the following help files in [R](http://www.r-project.org/):

{% highlight r %}
??rapport::rp.
{% endhighlight %}

A detailed documentation based on up-to-date Rd files is also available below. Of course you could check out the manual of the stable package in pdf format @ [CRAN](htpp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rapport) too.
