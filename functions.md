### Package functions

*rapport* is shipped with a bunch of (hopefully) handy functions to help you with writing templates. For a short introduction check out the following help files in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) interactive session:

{% highlight r %}
??rapport::rp.
{% endhighlight %}

A detailed documentation based on up-to-date `Rd` files is also available below. Of course, you could check out the manual of the stable package in _PDF_ format @ [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rapport) too.
