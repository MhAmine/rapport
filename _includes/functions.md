*rapport* has some really handy functions to help writing templates besides the main functions that generate, format and export those.

For a short introduction check out the following help files in [R](http://www.r-project.org/):

{% highlight r %}
?evals
?p
?rp.prettyascii
?rp.round
?table.json
{% endhighlight %}

A detailed documentation based on Rd files is to come here with run examples too, please be patient. Till then check out the manual in pdf format on [CRAN](htpp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rapport)!
