*rapport* is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package giving birth to a templating system that facilitates automated, mass and easy creation of statistical reports in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) with the option to export reports (to markdown/HTML/pdf/odt etc. formats) besides various tools and helpers to use in templates.

The package holds some [predefined, package shipped templates](#templates) but [custom templates](#custom) can be also created and run.
 
For a really short introduction run:

{% highlight r %}
demo(rapport)
{% endhighlight %}
