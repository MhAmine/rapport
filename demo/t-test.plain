Description
-----------

A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test
specific statistics.

Introduction
============

In a nutshell, t-test is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis of
equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields
statistic which follows t-distribution can be considered a t-test. The
most common usage of t-test is to:

-   compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value -
    one-sample t-test
-   compare means of two variables from independent samples -
    independent samples t-test
-   compare means of two variables from dependent samples -
    paired-samples t-test

Overview
========

Independent samples t-test is carried out with Internet usage in leisure
time (hours per day) as dependent variable, and Gender as independent
variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of variances
wasn't assumed.

Descriptives
============

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic
descriptive statistics is displayed below.

  y        min(x)   max(x)   mean(x)   sd(x)    var(x)   median(x)   IQR(x)   skewness(x)   kurtosis(x)
  -------- -------- -------- --------- -------- -------- ----------- -------- ------------- -------------
  male     0        12       3.2699    1.9535   3.8161   3           3        0.9479        4.0064
  female   0        12       3.0643    2.3546   5.5442   2           3        1.4064        4.9089
           0        10       3.3824    2.5822   6.6676   3           2        1.2197        3.8058

Diagnostics
===========

Since t-test is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions
on distribution shape: it has to be normal (or appoximately normal). A
few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible
departures from normality.

Normality Tests
---------------

We will use Shapiro-Wilk, Lilliefors and Anderson-Darling tests to
screen departures from normality in the response variable (Internet
usage in leisure time (hours per day)).

                 W        p
  -------------- -------- ---
  shapiro.test   0.9001   0
  lillie.test    0.168    0
  ad.test        18.753   0

As you can see, applied tests confirm departures from normality.

Results
=======

Welch Two Sample t-test was applied, and significant differences were
found.
