h3. Lund test

It seems that 4 extreme values can be found in &quot;Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)&quot;. These are: 10, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5.

h4. Explanation

The above test for outliers was based on _lm(1 ~ edu)_:

|_. |_. *Estimate*|_. *Std. Error*|_. *t value*|_. *Pr(&gt;&#124;t&#124;)*|
|(Intercept)|2.05|0.08|26.27|0.00|
