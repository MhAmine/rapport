h2. Lund test

It seems that _4_ extreme values can be found in &quot;Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)&quot;. These are: 10, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5.

h3. Explanation

The above test for outliers was based on _lm(1 ~ edu)_:

|_. |_. *Estimate*|_. *Std. Error*|_. *t value*|_. *Pr(&gt;&#124;t&#124;)*|
|(Intercept)|2.0481|0.078|26.2677|0|

h2. Grubb's test

Grubbs test for one outlier shows that highest value 12 is an outlier (p=0.0002).
