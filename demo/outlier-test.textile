h3. Lund test

It seems that 5 extreme values can be found in &quot;Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day)&quot;. These are: 10, 10, 12, 12, 12.

h4. Explanation

The above test for outliers was based on _lm(1 ~ edu)_:

|_. |_. *Estimate*|_. *Std. Error*|_. *t value*|_. *Pr(&gt;&#124;t&#124;)*|
|(Intercept)|2.06|0.08|26.92|0.00|

h3. Grubb's test

Grubbs test for one outlier shows that highest value 12 is an outlier (p=0.0003).
