It seems that the highest value is 12 which is exactly Inf times higher than the smalles values (0).

If we suppose that &quot;Internet usage for educational purposes (hours per day) is not near to a normal distribution (test: , skewness: 1.8593, kurtosis: 6.8501), checking the median (1) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range (2) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to standard deviation) based on median.
