** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of numerical or
frequency tables of categorical variables.

** /gender/ ("Gender")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /673/ valid values (missing:
/36/) in /gender/ ("Gender"), which seems to be a qualitative variable.

*** Base statistics

| *gender*   | *N*   | *%*       | *Cumul. N*   | *Cumul. %*   |
|------------+-------+-----------+--------------+--------------|
| male       | 410   | 60.9212   | 410          | 60.9212      |
| female     | 263   | 39.0788   | 673          | 100          |
| Total      | 673   | 100       | 673          | 100          |

It seems that the highest value is /2/ which is exactly 2 times higher
than the smallest value (/1/).

The most frequent value is /male/.

** /age/ ("Age")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /677/ valid values (missing:
/32/) in /age/ ("Age"), which seems to be a quantitative variable.

*** Base statistics

| *Variable*   | *mean*    | *sd*     | *var*     |
|--------------+-----------+----------+-----------|
| Age          | 24.5731   | 6.8491   | 46.9107   |

*** Histogram

It seems that the highest value is /58/ which is exactly 3.625 times
higher than the smallest value (/16/).

The standard deviation is /6.8491/ (variance: /46.9107/). The expected
value is around /24.5731/, somewhere between /24.0572/ and /25.0891/
with the standard error of /0.2632/.

If we suppose that /Age/ is not near to a normal distribution (test: see
below, skewness: /1.9296/, kurtosis: /7.4851/), checking the median
(/23/) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile
range (/6/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar
to standard deviation) based on median.

*** Normality tests

**** Introduction

In statistics, /normality/ refers to an assumption that the distribution
of a random variable follows /normal/ (/Gaussian/) distribution. Because
of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the /"bell curve"/. The
formula for /normal distribution/ is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$

/Normal distribution/ belongs to a /location-scale family/ of
distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

-  /μ/ - /mean/ or /expectation/ (location parameter)
-  /σ^{2}/ - /variance/ (scale parameter)

**** Normality Tests

***** Overview

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the
distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption.
These procedures test the H_{0} that provided variable's distribution is
/normal/. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones
that are available in =stats= package (which comes bundled with default
R installation) and =nortest= package that is
[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html][available]]
on CRAN.

-  *Shapiro-Wilk test* is a powerful normality test appropriate for
   small samples. In R, it's implemented in =shapiro.test= function
   available in =stats= package.
-  *Lilliefors test* is a modification of /Kolmogorov-Smirnov test/
   appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal
   distribution (/μ/, /σ^{2}/) are not known. =lillie.test= function is
   located in =nortest= package.
-  *Anderson-Darling test* is one of the most powerful normality tests
   as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find
   =ad.test= function in =nortest= package.
-  *Pearson Χ^{2} test* is another normality test which takes more
   "traditional" approach in normality testing. =pearson.test= is
   located in =nortest= package.

***** Results

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (/p-values/ less
than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

/0.05/

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test:

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /Age/ is not
   normal.
-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /Age/ is not normal
-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms violation of normality assumption
-  /Pearson's Χ^{2} test/ classifies the underlying distribution as
   non-normal

**** Diagnostic Plots

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of
the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown:
/histogram/, /Q-Q plot/ and /kernel density plot/.

***** Histogram

/Histogram/ was first introduced by /Karl Pearson/ and it's probably the
most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random
variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can
sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins
should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

***** Q-Q Plot

"Q" in /Q-Q plot/ stands for /quantile/, as this plot compares empirical
and theoretical distribution (in this case, /normal/ distribution) by
plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution,
plotted dots should approximate a "straight", =x = y= line.

***** Kernel Density Plot

/Kernel density plot/ is a plot of smoothed /empirical distribution
function/. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the
distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well
known "bell shape".

It seems that the highest value is /335/ which is exactly 6.4423 times
higher than the smallest value (/52/).

The standard deviation is /68.5629/ (variance: /4700.8669/). The
expected value is around /146.6875/, somewhere between /122.9317/ and
/170.4433/ with the standard error of /12.1203/.

If we suppose that /hp/ is not near to a normal distribution (test: see
below, skewness: /0.7614/, kurtosis: /3.0522/), checking the median
(/123/) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile
range (/83.5/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable
(similar to standard deviation) based on median.

In statistics, /normality/ refers to an assumption that the distribution
of a random variable follows /normal/ (/Gaussian/) distribution. Because
of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the /"bell curve"/. The
formula for /normal distribution/ is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$

/Normal distribution/ belongs to a /location-scale family/ of
distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

-  /μ/ - /mean/ or /expectation/ (location parameter)
-  /σ^{2}/ - /variance/ (scale parameter)

**** Normality Tests

***** Overview

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the
distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption.
These procedures test the H_{0} that provided variable's distribution is
/normal/. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones
that are available in =stats= package (which comes bundled with default
R installation) and =nortest= package that is
[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html][available]]
on CRAN.

-  *Shapiro-Wilk test* is a powerful normality test appropriate for
   small samples. In R, it's implemented in =shapiro.test= function
   available in =stats= package.
-  *Lilliefors test* is a modification of /Kolmogorov-Smirnov test/
   appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal
   distribution (/μ/, /σ^{2}/) are not known. =lillie.test= function is
   located in =nortest= package.
-  *Anderson-Darling test* is one of the most powerful normality tests
   as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find
   =ad.test= function in =nortest= package.
-  *Pearson Χ^{2} test* is another normality test which takes more
   "traditional" approach in normality testing. =pearson.test= is
   located in =nortest= package.

***** Results

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (/p-values/ less
than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

/0.05/

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test:

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /hp/ is not
   normal.
-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /hp/ is not normal
-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms normality assumption
-  /Pearson's Χ^{2} test/ classifies the underlying distribution as
   non-normal

**** Diagnostic Plots

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of
the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown:
/histogram/, /Q-Q plot/ and /kernel density plot/.

***** Histogram

/Histogram/ was first introduced by /Karl Pearson/ and it's probably the
most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random
variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can
sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins
should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

***** Q-Q Plot

"Q" in /Q-Q plot/ stands for /quantile/, as this plot compares empirical
and theoretical distribution (in this case, /normal/ distribution) by
plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution,
plotted dots should approximate a "straight", =x = y= line.

***** Kernel Density Plot

/Kernel density plot/ is a plot of smoothed /empirical distribution
function/. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the
distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well
known "bell shape".

** /wt/

The dataset has /32/ observations with /32/ valid values (missing: /0/)
in /wt/, which seems to be a quantitative variable.

*** Base statistics

| *Variable*   | *mean*   | *sd*     | *var*    |
|--------------+----------+----------+----------|
| wt           | 3.2172   | 0.9785   | 0.9574   |

*** Histogram

It seems that the highest value is /5.424/ which is exactly 3.5849 times
higher than the smallest value (/1.513/).

The standard deviation is /0.9785/ (variance: /0.9574/). The expected
value is around /3.2172/, somewhere between /2.8782/ and /3.5563/ with
the standard error of /0.173/.

If we suppose that /wt/ is not near to a normal distribution (test: see
below, skewness: /0.4438/, kurtosis: /3.1725/), checking the median
(/3.325/) might be a better option instead of the mean. The
interquartile range (/1.0288/) measures the statistics dispersion of the
variable (similar to standard deviation) based on median.
