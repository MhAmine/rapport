== Description ==

A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test specific statistics.

= Introduction =

In a nutshell, ''t-test'' is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields statistic which follows [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution ''t-distribution''] can be considered a ''t-test''. The most common usage of ''t-test'' is to:

* compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value - '''one-sample ''t-test'''''
* compare means of two variables from independent samples - '''independent samples ''t-test'''''
* compare means of two variables from dependent samples - '''paired-samples ''t-test'''''

= Overview =

Independent samples ''t-test'' is carried out with ''Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)'' as dependent variable, and ''Gender'' as independent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of variances wasn't assumed.

= Descriptives =

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic descriptive statistics is displayed below.

= Diagnostics =

Since ''t-test'' is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions on distribution shape: it has to be ''normal'' (or appoximately normal). A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible departures from normality.

== Normality Tests ==

We will use ''Shapiro-Wilk'', ''Lilliefors'' and ''Anderson-Darling'' tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable (''Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)'').
