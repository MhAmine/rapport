** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical, or a
frequency table of a categorical variable.

*** /gender/ ("Gender")

The dataset has 709 observations with 673 valid values (missing: 36) in
/gender/ ("Gender"). This variable seems to be a factor.

**** Base statistics

|         | *gender*   | *N*      | *pct*    | *cumul.count*   | *cumul.pct*   |
|---------+------------+----------+----------+-----------------+---------------|
| 1       | male       | 410.00   | 60.92    | 410.00          | 60.92         |
| 2       | female     | 263.00   | 39.08    | 673.00          | 100.00        |
| Total   |            | 673.00   | 100.00   | 673.00          | 100.00        |

**** Barplot

It seems that the highest value is 2 which is exactly 2 times higher
than the smallest value (1).

*** /age/ ("Age")

The dataset has 709 observations with 677 valid values (missing: 32) in
/age/ ("Age"). This variable seems to be numeric.

**** Base statistics

| *value*   | *mean(age)*   | *sd(age)*   | *var(age)*   |
|-----------+---------------+-------------+--------------|
| (all)     | 24.57         | 6.85        | 46.91        |

**** Histogram

It seems that the highest value is 58 which is exactly 3.625 times
higher than the smallest value (16).

The standard deviation is 6.8491 (variance: 46.911). The expected value
is around 24.573, somewhere between 24.057 and 25.089 (SE: 0.2632).

If we suppose that /Age/ is not near to a normal distribution (test: ,
skewness: 1.9296, kurtosis: 7.4851), checking the median (23) might be a
better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range (6) measures
the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to standard
deviation) based on median.
