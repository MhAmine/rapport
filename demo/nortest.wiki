=== Description ===

Overview of several normality tests and diagnostic plots that can screen departures from normality. 

=== Introduction ===

In statistics, _normality_ refers to an assumption that the distribution of a random variable follows _normal_ (_Gaussian_) distribution. Because of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the _"bell curve"_. The formula for _normal distribution_ is: 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$ 

_Normal distribution_ belongs to a _location-scale family_ of distributions, as it's defined two parameters: 

* *&mu;* - _mean_ or _expectation_ (location parameter)
* *&sigma;^2^* - _variance_ (scale parameter)

== Normality Tests ==

==== Overview ====

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption. These procedures test the H~0~ that provided variable's distribution is _normal_. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones that are available in `stats` package (which comes bundled with default R installation) and `nortest` package that is [available]([http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html]) on CRAN. 

* '''Shapiro-Wilk test''' is a powerful normality test appropriate for small samples. In R, it's implemented in `shapiro.test` function available in `stats` package.
* '''Lilliefors test''' is a modification of _Kolmogorov-Smirnov test_ appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal distribution (_&mu;_, _&sigma;^2^_) are not known. `lillie.test` function is located in `nortest` package.
* '''Anderson-Darling test''' is one of the most powerful normality tests as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find `ad.test` function in `nortest` package.
* '''Pearson &Chi;^2^ test''' is another normality test which takes more "traditional" approach in normality testing. `pearson.test` is located in `nortest` package. 

=== Results ===

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (_p-values_ less than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      0.9001          0

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test: 

* according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ is not normal.
* based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ is not normal
* _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption
* _Pearson's &Chi;^2^ test_ classifies the underlying distribution as normal 

== Diagnostic Plots ==

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown: _histogram_, _Q-Q plot_ and _kernel density plot_. 

==== Histogram ====

_Histogram_ was first introduced by _Karl Pearson_ and it's probably the most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

==== Q-Q Plot ====

"Q" in _Q-Q plot_ stands for _quantile_, as this plot compares empirical and theoretical distribution (in this case, _normal_ distribution) by plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution, plotted dots should approximate a "straight", `x = y` line.

==== Kernel Density Plot ====

_Kernel density plot_ is a plot of smoothed _empirical distribution function_. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well known "bell shape".
