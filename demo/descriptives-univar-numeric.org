** Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical
variable.

** /age/ ("Age")

The dataset has /709/ observations with /677/ valid values (missing:
/32/) in /age/ ("Age"), which seems to be a quantitative variable.

*** Base statistics

| *Variable*   | *mean*    | *sd*     | *var*     |
|--------------+-----------+----------+-----------|
| Age          | 24.5731   | 6.8491   | 46.9107   |

*** Histogram

It seems that the highest value is /58/ which is exactly 3.625 times
higher than the smallest value (/16/).

The standard deviation is /6.8491/ (variance: /46.9107/). The expected
value is around /24.5731/, somewhere between /24.0572/ and /25.0891/
with the standard error of /0.2632/.

If we suppose that /Age/ is not near to a normal distribution (test: see
below, skewness: /1.9296/, kurtosis: /7.4851/), checking the median
(/23/) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile
range (/6/) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar
to standard deviation) based on median.

*** Normality tests

**** Introduction

In statistics, /normality/ refers to an assumption that the distribution
of a random variable follows /normal/ (/Gaussian/) distribution. Because
of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the /"bell curve"/. The
formula for /normal distribution/ is:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$

/Normal distribution/ belongs to a /location-scale family/ of
distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

-  /μ/ - /mean/ or /expectation/ (location parameter)
-  /σ^{2}/ - /variance/ (scale parameter)

**** Normality Tests

***** Overview

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the
distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption.
These procedures test the H_{0} that provided variable's distribution is
/normal/. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones
that are available in =stats= package (which comes bundled with default
R installation) and =nortest= package that is
[[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html][available]]
on CRAN.

-  *Shapiro-Wilk test* is a powerful normality test appropriate for
   small samples. In R, it's implemented in =shapiro.test= function
   available in =stats= package.
-  *Lilliefors test* is a modification of /Kolmogorov-Smirnov test/
   appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal
   distribution (/μ/, /σ^{2}/) are not known. =lillie.test= function is
   located in =nortest= package.
-  *Anderson-Darling test* is one of the most powerful normality tests
   as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find
   =ad.test= function in =nortest= package.
-  *Pearson Χ^{2} test* is another normality test which takes more
   "traditional" approach in normality testing. =pearson.test= is
   located in =nortest= package.

***** Results

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (/p-values/ less
than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

/0.05/

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test:

-  according to /Shapiro-Wilk test/, the distribution of /Age/ is not
   normal.
-  based on /Lilliefors test/, distribution of /Age/ is not normal
-  /Anderson-Darling test/ confirms violation of normality assumption
-  /Pearson's Χ^{2} test/ classifies the underlying distribution as
   non-normal

**** Diagnostic Plots

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of
the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown:
/histogram/, /Q-Q plot/ and /kernel density plot/.

***** Histogram

/Histogram/ was first introduced by /Karl Pearson/ and it's probably the
most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random
variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can
sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins
should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

***** Q-Q Plot

"Q" in /Q-Q plot/ stands for /quantile/, as this plot compares empirical
and theoretical distribution (in this case, /normal/ distribution) by
plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution,
plotted dots should approximate a "straight", =x = y= line.

***** Kernel Density Plot

/Kernel density plot/ is a plot of smoothed /empirical distribution
function/. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the
distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well
known "bell shape".
