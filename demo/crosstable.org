** Description

Returning the Chi-squared test of two given variables with count,
percentages and Pearson's residuals table.

*** Variable description

Two variables specified:

-  "gender" ("Gender") with 709 and
-  "dwell" ("Dwelling") with 709 valid values.

*** Counts

|          | *city*   | *small town*   | *village*   |
|----------+----------+----------------+-------------|
| male     | 380      | 30             | 22          |
| female   | 262      | 6              | 9           |

*** Percentages

|          | *city*   | *small town*   | *village*   |
|----------+----------+----------------+-------------|
| male     | 0.5360   | 0.0423         | 0.0310      |
| female   | 0.3695   | 0.0085         | 0.0127      |

**** Row percentages

|          | *city*   | *small town*   | *village*   |
|----------+----------+----------------+-------------|
| male     | 0.8796   | 0.0694         | 0.0509      |
| female   | 0.9458   | 0.0217         | 0.0325      |

**** Column percentages

|          | *city*   | *small town*   | *village*   |
|----------+----------+----------------+-------------|
| male     | 0.5919   | 0.8333         | 0.7097      |
| female   | 0.4081   | 0.1667         | 0.2903      |

*** Chi-squared test

|             | *X-squared*   | *df*   | *p-value*   |
|-------------+---------------+--------+-------------|
| X-squared   | 9.72          | 2.00   | 0.01        |

It seems that a real association can be pointed out between /gender/ and
/dwell/ by the /Pearson's Chi-squared test/ (χ=9.7188 at the degree of
freedom being 2) at the significance level of 0.0078. Based on Goodman
and Kruskal's lambda it seems that /dwell/ (λ=0.7581) has an effect on
/gender/ (λ=0) if we assume both variables to be nominal. The
association between the two variables seems to be weak based on Cramer's
V (0.0828).

**** Pearson's residuals

|          | *city*    | *small town*   | *village*   |
|----------+-----------+----------------+-------------|
| male     | -2.9409   | 2.8277         | 1.1713      |
| female   | 2.9409    | -2.8277        | -1.1713     |
