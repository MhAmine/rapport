## Description 

A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test specific statistics. 

## Introduction 

In a nutshell, _t-test_ is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields statistic which follows [_t-distribution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) can be considered a _t-test_. The most common usage of _t-test_ is to: 

 - compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value - **one-sample _t-test_**
 - compare means of two variables from independent samples - **independent samples _t-test_**
 - compare means of two variables from dependent samples - **paired-samples _t-test_** 

## Overview 

Independent samples _t-test_ is carried out with _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ as dependent variable, and _Gender_ as independent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of variances wasn't assumed. 

## Descriptives 

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic descriptive statistics is displayed below. 


**y**    **min(x)**   **max(x)**   **mean(x)**   **sd(x)**   **var(x)**   **median(x)**   **IQR(x)**   **skewness(x)**   **kurtosis(x)**  
-------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------- ------------ --------------- ------------ ----------------- -----------------
male     0            12           3.2699        1.9535      3.8161       3               3            0.9479            4.0064

-------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----------- ------------ --------------- ------------ ----------------- -----------------
 

## Diagnostics 

Since _t-test_ is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions on distribution shape: it has to be _normal_ (or appoximately normal). A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible departures from normality.  

### Normality Tests 

We will use _Shapiro-Wilk_, _Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable (_Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_).  

<!-- endlist -->

               **W**    **p**  
-------------- -------- -------
shapiro.test   0.9001   0      
lillie.test    0.168    0      
ad.test        18.753   0      
-------------- -------- -------
 

As you can see, applied tests confirm departures from normality. 

## Results 

Welch Two Sample t-test was applied, and significant differences were found. 

<!-- endlist -->

    **statistic**   **df**     **p**    **CI(lower)**   **CI(upper)**
