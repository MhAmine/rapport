h2. Description

A t-test report with table of descriptives, diagnostic tests and t-test specific statistics.

h2. Introduction

In a nutshell, _t-test_ is a statistical test that assesses hypothesis of equality of two means. But in theory, any hypothesis test that yields statistic which follows "_t-distribution_":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution can be considered a _t-test_. The most common usage of _t-test_ is to:

* compare the mean of a variable with given test mean value - *one-sample _t-test_*
* compare means of two variables from independent samples - *independent samples _t-test_*
* compare means of two variables from dependent samples - *paired-samples _t-test_*

h2. Overview

Independent samples _t-test_ is carried out with _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ as dependent variable, and _Gender_ as independent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of variances wasn't assumed.

h2. Descriptives

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic descriptive statistics is displayed below.

|_. *Gender*|_. *min*|_. *max*|_. *mean*|_. *sd*|_. *var*|_. *median*|_. *IQR*|_. *skewness*|_. *kurtosis*|
|male|0|12|3.2699|1.9535|3.8161|3|3|0.9479|4.0064|
|female|0|12|3.0643|2.3546|5.5442|2|3|1.4064|4.9089|


h2. Diagnostics

Since _t-test_ is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions on distribution shape: it has to be _normal_ (or appoximately normal). A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible departures from normality.

h3. Normality Tests

We will use _Shapiro-Wilk_, _Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the response variable (_Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_).

<!-- endlist -->

|_. |_. *N*|_. *p*|
|Shapiro-Wilk normality test|0.9001|0|
|Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test|0.168|0|
|Anderson-Darling normality test|18.753|0|


As you can see, applied tests confirm departures from normality.

h2. Results

Welch Two Sample t-test was applied, and significant differences were found.

One-sample _t-test_ is carried out with _Internet usage in leisure time (hours per day)_ as dependent variable. Confidence interval is set to 95%. Equality of variances wasn't assumed.
