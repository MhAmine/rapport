\subsection{Description}

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical
variable.

\subsection{\emph{age} (``Age'')}

The dataset has \emph{709} observations with \emph{677} valid values
(missing: \emph{32}) in \emph{age} (``Age''), which seems to be a
quantitative variable.

\subsubsection{Base statistics}

\end{figure}

It seems that the highest value is \emph{58} which is exactly 3.625
times higher than the smallest value (\emph{16}).

The standard deviation is \emph{6.8491} (variance: \emph{46.9107}). The
expected value is around \emph{24.5731}, somewhere between
\emph{24.0572} and \emph{25.0891} with the standard error of
\emph{0.2632}.

If we suppose that \emph{Age} is not near to a normal distribution
(test: see below, skewness: \emph{1.9296}, kurtosis: \emph{7.4851}),
checking the median (\emph{23}) might be a better option instead of the
mean. The interquartile range (\emph{6}) measures the statistics
dispersion of the variable (similar to standard deviation) based on
median.

\subsubsection{Normality tests}

\paragraph{Introduction}

In statistics, \emph{normality} refers to an assumption that the
distribution of a random variable follows \emph{normal}
(\emph{Gaussian}) distribution. Because of its bell-like shape, it's
also known as the \emph{``bell curve''}. The formula for \emph{normal
distribution} is:

\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}\]

\emph{Normal distribution} belongs to a \emph{location-scale family} of
distributions, as it's defined two parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{μ} - \emph{mean} or \emph{expectation} (location parameter)
\item
  \emph{σ\textsuperscript{2}} - \emph{variance} (scale parameter)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Normality Tests}

\subparagraph{Overview}

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the
distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption.
These procedures test the H\textsubscr{0} that provided variable's
distribution is \emph{normal}. At this point only few such tests will be
covered: the ones that are available in \texttt{stats} package (which
comes bundled with default R installation) and \texttt{nortest} package
that is
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html}{available}
on CRAN.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Shapiro-Wilk test} is a powerful normality test appropriate
  for small samples. In R, it's implemented in \texttt{shapiro.test}
  function available in \texttt{stats} package.
\item
  \textbf{Lilliefors test} is a modification of \emph{Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  test} appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal
  distribution (\emph{μ}, \emph{σ\textsuperscript{2}}) are not known.
  \texttt{lillie.test} function is located in \texttt{nortest} package.
\item
  \textbf{Anderson-Darling test} is one of the most powerful normality
  tests as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can
  find \texttt{ad.test} function in \texttt{nortest} package.
\item
  \textbf{Pearson Χ\textsuperscript{2} test} is another normality test
  which takes more ``traditional'' approach in normality testing.
  \texttt{pearson.test} is located in \texttt{nortest} package.
\end{itemize}
\subparagraph{Results}

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (\emph{p-values}
less than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

\emph{0.05}

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  according to \emph{Shapiro-Wilk test}, the distribution of \emph{Age}
  is not normal.
\item
  based on \emph{Lilliefors test}, distribution of \emph{Age} is not
  normal
\item
  \emph{Anderson-Darling test} confirms violation of normality
  assumption
\item
  \emph{Pearson's Χ\textsuperscript{2} test} classifies the underlying
  distribution as non-normal
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Diagnostic Plots}

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of
the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown:
\emph{histogram}, \emph{Q-Q plot} and \emph{kernel density plot}.

\subparagraph{Histogram}

\emph{Histogram} was first introduced by \emph{Karl Pearson} and it's
probably the most popular plot for depicting the probability
distribution of a random variable. However, the decision depends on
number of bins, so it can sometimes be misleading. If the variable
distribution is normal, bins should resemble the ``bell-like'' shape.

\subparagraph{Q-Q Plot}

``Q'' in \emph{Q-Q plot} stands for \emph{quantile}, as this plot
compares empirical and theoretical distribution (in this case,
\emph{normal} distribution) by plotting their quantiles against each
other. For normal distribution, plotted dots should approximate a
``straight'', \texttt{x = y} line.

\subparagraph{Kernel Density Plot}

\emph{Kernel density plot} is a plot of smoothed \emph{empirical
distribution function}. As such, it provides good insight about the
shape of the distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble
the well known ``bell shape''.
