h2. Description

Returning the Chi-squared test of two given variables with count, percentages and Pearson's residuals table.

h3. Variable description

Two variables specified: &#42; &quot;gender&quot; (&quot;Gender&quot;) with 709 and &#42; &quot;dwell&quot; (&quot;Dwelling&quot;) with 709 valid values.

h3. Counts

|_. |_. *city*|_. *small town*|_. *village*|
|male|380|30|22|
|female|262|6|9|


h3. Percentages

h4. Column percentages

|male|0.5919|0.8333|0.7097|
|female|0.4081|0.1667|0.2903|


h3. Chi-squared test

|X-squared|9.72|2.00|0.01|


It seems that a real association can be pointed out between _gender_ and _dwell_ by the _Pearson's Chi-squared test_ (χ=9.7188 at the degree of freedom being 2) at the significance level of 0.0078. Based on Goodman and Kruskal's lambda it seems that _dwell_ (λ=0.7581) has an effect on _gender_ (λ=0) if we assume both variables to be nominal. The association between the two variables seems to be weak based on Cramer's V (0.0828).

|female|2.9409|-2.8277|-1.1713|
