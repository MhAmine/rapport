h2. Description

Returning the Chi-squared test of two given variables with count, percentages and Pearson's residuals table.

h2. Variable description

Two variables specified:

* &quot;gender&quot; (&quot;Gender&quot;) with _673_ and
* &quot;dwell&quot; (&quot;Dwelling&quot;) with _662_ valid values.

h2. Chi-squared test

|_. |_. *X-squared*|_. *df*|_. *p-value*|
|X-squared|12.6353|2|0.0018|


It seems that a real association can be pointed out between _gender_ and _dwell_ by the _Pearson's Chi-squared test_ (χ=12.6353 at the degree of freedom being 2) at the significance level of 0.0018. Based on Goodman and Kruskal's lambda it seems that _dwell_ (λ=0.7602) has an effect on _gender_ (λ=0) if we assume both variables to be nominal. The association between the two variables seems to be weak based on Cramer's V (0.1001).
