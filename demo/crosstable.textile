h3. Chi-squared test

|_. |_. *X-squared*|_. *df*|_. *p-value*|
|X-squared|9.71883|2.00000|0.00776|



|It seems that a real association can be pointed out between _gender_ and _dwell_ by the _Pearson's Chi-squared test_ (χ=9.7188 at the degree of freedom being 2) at the significance level of 0.00776.|
|Based on Goodman and Kruskal's lambda it seems that _dwell_ (λ=0.75812) has an effect on _gender_ (λ=0) if we assume both variables to be nominal.|
|The association between the two variables seems to be weak based on Cramer's V (0.08279).|


h4. Pearson's residuals
