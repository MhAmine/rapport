=== Description ===

This template will return descriptive statistics of a numerical variable. 

=== *age* ("Age") ===

The dataset has _709_ observations with _677_ valid values (missing: _32_) in *age* ("Age"), which seems to be a quantitative variable. 

==== Base statistics ====

'''Variable'''   '''mean'''   '''sd'''   '''var'''

Age            24.5731    6.8491   46.9107  
<s>----------</s> <s>------</s> <s>----</s> <s>-----</s>

It seems that the highest value is _58_ which is exactly 3.625 times higher than the smallest value (_16_). 

The standard deviation is _6.8491_ (variance: _46.9107_). The expected value is around _24.5731_, somewhere between _24.0572_ and _25.0891_ with the standard error of _0.2632_. 

If we suppose that *Age* is not near to a normal distribution (test: see below, skewness: _1.9254_, kurtosis: _4.463_), checking the median (_23_) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range (_6_) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to standard deviation) based on median. 

==== Normality tests ====

===== Introduction =====

In statistics, _normality_ refers to an assumption that the distribution of a random variable follows _normal_ (_Gaussian_) distribution. Because of its bell-like shape, it's also known as the _"bell curve"_. The formula for _normal distribution_ is: 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi{}\sigma{}^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu{})^2}{2\sigma{}^2}}$$ 

_Normal distribution_ belongs to a _location-scale family_ of distributions, as it's defined two parameters: 

* *&mu;* - _mean_ or _expectation_ (location parameter)
* *&sigma;^2^* - _variance_ (scale parameter)

===== Normality Tests =====

====== Overview ======

Various hypothesis tests can be applied in order to test if the distribution of given random variable violates normality assumption. These procedures test the H~0~ that provided variable's distribution is _normal_. At this point only few such tests will be covered: the ones that are available in `stats` package (which comes bundled with default R installation) and `nortest` package that is [available]([http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html]) on CRAN. 

* '''Shapiro-Wilk test''' is a powerful normality test appropriate for small samples. In R, it's implemented in `shapiro.test` function available in `stats` package.
* '''Lilliefors test''' is a modification of _Kolmogorov-Smirnov test_ appropriate for testing normality when parameters or normal distribution (_&mu;_, _&sigma;^2^_) are not known. `lillie.test` function is located in `nortest` package.
* '''Anderson-Darling test''' is one of the most powerful normality tests as it will detect the most of departures from normality. You can find `ad.test` function in `nortest` package.
* '''Pearson &Chi;^2^ test''' is another normality test which takes more "traditional" approach in normality testing. `pearson.test` is located in `nortest` package. 

===== Results =====

Here you can see the results of applied normality tests (_p-values_ less than 0.05 indicate significant discrepancies):

                                                 '''Statistic'''   '''p-value'''  
<s>--------------------------------------------</s> <s>-----------</s> <s>---------</s>
Shapiro-Wilk normality test                      0.8216          0            
Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality test   0.17            0            
Anderson-Darling normality test                  32.1645         0            
Pearson chi-square normality test                625.8479        0            
<s>--------------------------------------------</s> <s>-----------</s> <s>---------</s>

So, let's draw some conclusions based on applied normality test: 

* according to _Shapiro-Wilk test_, the distribution of _Age_ is not normal.
* based on _Lilliefors test_, distribution of _Age_ is not normal
* _Anderson-Darling test_ confirms violation of normality assumption
* _Pearson's &Chi;^2^ test_ classifies the underlying distribution as non-normal 

==== Diagnostic Plots ====

There are various plots that can help you decide about the normality of the distribution. Only a few most commonly used plots will be shown: _histogram_, _Q-Q plot_ and _kernel density plot_. 

====== Histogram ======

_Histogram_ was first introduced by _Karl Pearson_ and it's probably the most popular plot for depicting the probability distribution of a random variable. However, the decision depends on number of bins, so it can sometimes be misleading. If the variable distribution is normal, bins should resemble the "bell-like" shape.

====== Q-Q Plot ======

"Q" in _Q-Q plot_ stands for _quantile_, as this plot compares empirical and theoretical distribution (in this case, _normal_ distribution) by plotting their quantiles against each other. For normal distribution, plotted dots should approximate a "straight", `x = y` line.

====== Kernel Density Plot ======

_Kernel density plot_ is a plot of smoothed _empirical distribution function_. As such, it provides good insight about the shape of the distribution. For normal distributions, it should resemble the well known "bell shape".
