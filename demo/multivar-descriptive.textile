h2. Description

This template will return descriptive statistics of numerical, or frequency tables of categorical variables.

h3. _gender_ (&quot;Gender&quot;)

The dataset has 709 observations with 709 valid values (missing: 0) in _gender_ (&quot;Gender&quot;). This variable seems to be a factor.

It seems that the highest value is 2 which is exactly 2 times higher than the smallest value (1).

h3. _age_ (&quot;Age&quot;)

The dataset has 709 observations with 709 valid values (missing: 0) in _age_ (&quot;Age&quot;). This variable seems to be numeric.

It seems that the highest value is 58 which is exactly 3.625 times higher than the smallest value (16).

The standard deviation is 6.8399 (variance: 46.784). The expected value is around 24.557, somewhere between 24.054 and 25.061 (SE: 0.2569).

If we suppose that _Age_ is not near to a normal distribution (test: , skewness: 1.9568, kurtosis: 7.6428), checking the median (23) might be a better option instead of the mean. The interquartile range (6) measures the statistics dispersion of the variable (similar to standard deviation) based on median.
