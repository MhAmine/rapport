h2. Description

This template will return the correlation matrix of supplied numerical variables.

h2. Variable description

_3_ variables provided.

The highest correlation coefficient (0.2273) is between _edu_ and _age_ and the lowest (-0.0338) is between _leisure_ and _age_. It seems that the strongest association (r=0.2273) is between _edu_ and _age_.

Highly correlated (r &lt; 0.7 or r &gt; 0.7) variables: -

Uncorrelated (-0.2 &lt; r &lt; 0.2) variables:

* _age_ and _leisure_
* _edu_ and _leisure_
